# Assignment 2 - Dijkstra
## Tasks
1. Modify the graph data structure shown in tutorial 3 to accommodate graphs with weighted edges. Then build the graph shown in the figure above.
2. Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between source node a and destination node f. You may use the inbuilt priority queue data structure provided by Python: https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html. If you want, you can implement the Priority Queue data structure on your own, but, it is optional.

## Instructions for execution
1. change to current working directory to Assignment2

```bash
cd Assignment2
```
2. Run the python file
```bash
python dijkstra.py
```
