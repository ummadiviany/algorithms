# Assignment 4 - Revised Simplex Algorithm

## Instructions for execution
1. change to current working directory to **Assignment4**

```bash
cd Assignment4
```
2. Run the python file
```bash
python revised_simplex.py
```
3. Also to run simplex algorithm run the following command
```bash
python simplex_tabular.py
## Tasks
    1. Implementing the revised simplex algorithm
    2. Find the maximum value of the objective function for the given input


## Final Output
    Objective function : Z = 4x1 + 3x2
    Optimal coefficeint for x1 : 1.5 and x2 : 1
    Maximum value of the objective function: 9.0
